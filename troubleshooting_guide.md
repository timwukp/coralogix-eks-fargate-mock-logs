# Amazon Q Developer CLI Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides comprehensive examples of how to use Amazon Q Developer CLI with the mock Coralogix EKS Fargate logs for troubleshooting various scenarios.

## üéØ Overview

The mock logs in this demo represent a realistic microservices architecture running on EKS Fargate with common production issues. Use Amazon Q Developer CLI to analyze these logs and identify problems using natural language queries.

```

## üö® Specific Service Analysis

### Frontend Issues
```bash
q chat "What problems are affecting the web-frontend service? Include both nginx and application container issues."

q chat "Help me troubleshoot any user-facing issues indicated in the frontend logs."
```

### Backend Services
```bash
q chat "What issues are affecting the user-service and payment-service? How are they related?"

q chat "Help me understand any backend service failures and their impact on the application."
```

### System Services
```bash
q chat "What problems do you see with system services like CoreDNS, load balancer controller, or cert-manager?"

q chat "Help me troubleshoot any kube-system namespace issues that might affect the entire cluster."
```

## üîß Operational Queries

### Monitoring and Alerting
```bash
q chat "Based on these logs, what monitoring alerts should I set up to catch these issues early?"

q chat "What are the key metrics I should track to prevent these problems?"

q chat "Help me prioritize which issues need immediate attention vs. longer-term fixes."
```

### Remediation Steps
```bash
q chat "What immediate steps should I take to resolve the most critical issues in these logs?"

q chat "Help me create a prioritized action plan for fixing these problems."

q chat "What preventive measures can I implement to avoid these issues in the future?"
```

## üìä Advanced Analysis

### Correlation Analysis
```bash
q chat "Help me correlate errors across different services. Are there any common root causes?"

q chat "What patterns do you see in the timing of these errors? Are they related to specific events?"

q chat "Can you identify any environmental factors (like deployment times) that correlate with error spikes?"
```

### Capacity Planning
```bash
q chat "Based on these error patterns, what capacity or scaling recommendations do you have?"

q chat "What resource allocation changes might help prevent these issues?"

q chat "Help me understand if these errors indicate architectural problems that need addressing."
```

## üéØ Scenario-Based Troubleshooting

### Incident Response
```bash
q chat "If I were responding to a production incident, what would be the top 3 issues to investigate first based on these logs?"

q chat "Help me create an incident timeline based on the error patterns in these logs."

q chat "What evidence of service degradation do you see, and how would you communicate this to stakeholders?"
```

### Post-Incident Analysis
```bash
q chat "Conduct a post-incident analysis of these logs. What were the contributing factors and how could they be prevented?"

q chat "What systemic issues do these logs reveal that need architectural changes?"

q chat "Help me identify the blast radius of the main issues - which services and users were affected?"
```

## üí° Tips for Effective Queries

### Be Specific
- Include specific service names, error types, or time ranges when relevant
- Ask for both symptoms and potential root causes
- Request actionable recommendations, not just problem identification

### Use Context
- Reference the EKS Fargate environment and Coralogix format
- Mention that these are microservices logs with Kubernetes metadata
- Specify if you're looking for immediate fixes vs. long-term improvements

### Follow Up
- Ask clarifying questions based on initial responses
- Request more details about specific errors or patterns
- Ask for validation of your own hypotheses

### Example Follow-up Sequence
```bash
# Initial query
q chat "What are the main database issues in these logs?"

# Follow-up based on response
q chat "You mentioned connection pool exhaustion. Can you show me which services are most affected and suggest specific configuration changes?"

# Deeper analysis
q chat "If I increase the connection pool size, what other bottlenecks might I encounter based on these logs?"
```

## üîÑ Iterative Analysis

Use Amazon Q Developer CLI iteratively to drill down into issues:

1. **Start broad**: "What are the main issues in these logs?"
2. **Focus on categories**: "Tell me more about the database problems"
3. **Get specific**: "What's causing the connection timeouts in the payment-service?"
4. **Seek solutions**: "How should I fix the database connection pool configuration?"
5. **Validate**: "Are there other services that might have similar issues?"

## üìù Documentation Integration

Use Amazon Q to help create documentation:

```bash
q chat "Based on these logs, help me create a runbook for troubleshooting database connectivity issues in our EKS cluster."

q chat "Generate monitoring queries I should set up in Coralogix to detect these types of issues proactively."

q chat "Create a checklist for investigating service mesh issues based on the patterns you see in these logs."
```
